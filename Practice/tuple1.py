# Exercise 1: Reverse the tuple

# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
# tuple1 = tuple1[3::-1]
# print(tuple1)

# Exercise 2: Access value 20 from the tuple

# tuple1 = ("Orange",[10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))

# print(tuple1[1][1])

# Exercise 3: Create a tuple with single item 50

# tuple1= (50, )
# print(tuple1)

# Exercise 4: Unpack the tuple into 4 variables

# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# a, b, c, d = tuple1

# print(a)
# print(b)
# print(c)
# print(d)

# Exercise 5: Swap two tuples in Python

# tuple1 = (11, 22)
# tuple2 = (99, 88)

# tuple1, tuple2 = tuple2, tuple1
# print(tuple2)
# print(tuple1)

# Exercise 6: Copy specific elements from one tuple to a new tuple

# tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)
# tuple2 = tuple1[3:-1]
# print(tuple2)

# Exercise 7: Modify the tuple

tuple1 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
tuple1[1][0] = 222
print(tuple1)
