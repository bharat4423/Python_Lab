# Q.1. Write a program that asks the user how many days are in a particular month, and what day of the week the month begins on (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc), and then prints a calendar for that month. For example, here is the output for a 30-day month that begins on day 4 (Thursday):
# S M T W T F S
# 1 2 3
# 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
# 11 12 13 14 15 16 17
# 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
# 25 26 27 28 29 30


# Get input from the user
num_days = int(input("Enter the number of days in the month: "))
start_day = int(input("Enter the starting day of the month (0 for Monday, 1 for Tuesday, etc): "))

# Create a list of the days of the week
days_of_week = [" S ", "M ", "T ", "W ", "T ", "F ", "S "]

# Print the header row
for day in days_of_week:
    print(day, end=" ")
print()

# Print the calendar
day_num = 1
while day_num <= num_days:
    # Print each week
    for day_index in range(len(days_of_week)):
        if day_num == 1 and day_index < start_day:
            # Print an empty space until we reach the starting day
            print("  ", end=" ")
        elif day_num > num_days:
            # Stop printing days if we've reached the end of the month
            break
        else:
            # Print the day number
            print("{:2d}".format(day_num), end=" ")
            day_num += 1
    # Move to the next line for the next week
    print()
